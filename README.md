## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links
- Live Site URL: (https://lythmass.github.io/Sunnyside-landing-page/)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

The experience and knowledge that I got from this project is very useful, now I know that creating a design for mobile first needs less work and time, furthermore structuring HTML first and then working on CSS was more efficient in my case, also Flexbox is magic.

### Continued development

The important parts of responsiveness is using min, max, clamp functions and I am not really comfortable with these functions, which is something I need to work on.
